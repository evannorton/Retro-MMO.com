        <p>This page is used to inform visitors regarding our policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of
            Personal Information if anyone decided to use our Service.</p>
        <p>If you choose to use our Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this
            policy. The Personal Information that we collect is used for providing and improving the Service. We will
            not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
        <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
        <p>For a better experience, while using our Service, we may require you to provide us with certain personally
            identifiable information, including but not limited to username, email address, IP address, browser user
            agent. The information that we request will be retained by us and used as described in this privacy policy.
        </p>
        <p>The game does use third party services that may collect information used to identify you.</p>
        <h2>Link to privacy policy of third party service providers used by the game</h2>
        <div class="left-centered-text">
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-US" target="_blank">Google Analytics</a></li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <h2>Log Data</h2>
        <p>We want to inform you that whenever you use our Service, in a case of an error in the game we collect data
            and information (through third party products) on your phone called Log Data. This Log Data may include
            information such as your device Internet Protocol ("IP") address, device name, operating system version, the
            configuration of the game when utilizing our Service, the time and date of your use of the Service, and
            other statistics.</p>
        <h2>Cookies</h2>
        <p>Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These
            are sent to your browser from the websites that you visit and are stored on your device's internal memory.
        </p>
        <p>This Service does not use these "cookies" explicitly. However, the game may use third party code and
            libraries that use "cookies" to collect information and improve their services. You have the option to
            either accept or refuse these cookies and know when a cookie is being sent to your device. If you choose to
            refuse our cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of this Service.</p>
        <h2>Local Storage</h2>
        <p>Local storage is another type of data stored in your browser. Data placed in local storage is per origin—the
            combination of protocol, host name, and port number as defined in the same-origin policy. The data is
            available to all scripts loaded from pages from the same origin that previously stored the data and persists
            after the browser is closed. RetroMMO uses local storage to persist user settings such as game controls,
            video settings and audio settings.</p>
        <h2>Service Providers</h2>
        <p>We may employ third-party companies and individuals due to the following reasons:</p>

                <li>We want to inform users of this Service that these third parties have access to your Personal
                    Information.</li>
                <li>The reason is to perform the tasks assigned to them on our behalf. However, they are obligated not
                    to
                    disclose or use the information for any other purpose.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <p>We value your trust in providing us your Personal Information, thus we are striving to use commercially
            acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method
            of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
